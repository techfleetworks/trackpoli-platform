// The route-guard decisions (TP1-06), as pure functions so every guard is unit-tested directly against every
// status × role — no React, no Next, no DOM. The guard wrapper components and the middleware both apply these.
//
// These guards are a ROUTING/RENDERING layer, exactly like RequireMfa (ADR-0009): they decide which screen a
// session lands on. They are NOT the authorization boundary — the database (RLS) is, denying an administrator
// manager table regardless of how they reached the route (ADR-0005/0009/0012). So a role/status read that is
// missing or wrong is a cosmetic routing bug, never a data exposure. Role/status come from the verified
// access-token claims; MFA (aal) is handled by decideMfaGate, and terms is an inert slot until its screen
// lands (ADR-0012).

// RequireRole — must hold the required role. Not signed in → sign-in; any other role, or an unreadable role
// → forbidden. Unknown role is denied (fail CLOSED for the UX of a privileged route): we never render a
// manager screen to a session whose role we cannot confirm. The data is protected by RLS either way, so on
// the rare transient read failure a real manager sees the forbidden screen rather than manager UI leaking.

// RequireTerms is now LIVE and lives with the other middleware routing gates: see
// src/features/auth/termsGate.ts (decideTermsGate), wired into src/middleware.ts between the sign-in guard
// and RequireMfa (TP1-08, Q-1-20). It is path-aware (unlike the earlier inert slot), so it belongs next to
// decideMfaGate rather than here among the client-wrapper decisions. The restrictive RLS (migration 009)
// remains the authorization boundary (ADR-0012).
